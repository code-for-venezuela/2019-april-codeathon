# Code for Venezuela - April 2019 Codeathon

This repo contains all the information needed for both in-person and remote participation in the event.

First, let us take a moment to say thank you! You are awesome and we really appreciate the time and effort you are putting into this.

## What to expect from this Hackathon?

The ultimate goal of this Hackathon is to bootstrap a network of people that would like to help with the current Venezuelan situation ‚Äî making sure that we use our skills and energies towards initiatives that have a direct impact in the country.

Here are a few things that we want you to have in mind:

0. We don't expect to have fully fleshed out solutions to the challenges proposed for this Hackathon. We want you to have fun while working on projects that have the potential to make a difference in Venezuela.
1. This community is real! We are very excited to see people from so many parts of the world getting together for this event, let's embrace our community and nurture it.
2. If you like one of the challenges and would like to continue working on it after the Hackathon, please reach out! We want to form brigades that continue to work on these problems beyond the scope of this weekend.


## During the Event

1. **Teams**:
    1. Make sure to have a team.
    2. We want to bring together: developers, PMs, Data scientists, designers etc.
    3. A team could be made up of engineers only or a mix of cross-discipline teammates.
    4. We encourage freedom to innovate and be creative.
    5. Recommended team size: 3 to 5 people. Ideally in the same location you are participating from. This will make it easier to collaborate!
2. **Logistics:**
    1. Slack will be the main communication channel for the event. Please use [#hackathon-ga](https://codeforvenezuela.slack.com/messages/CH5JMFBB2) to post questions and requests.
    2. Streaming: When there are talks or workshops, we will make sure we have a video stream available for remote participants. We will post the links in [#hackathon-ga](https://codeforvenezuela.slack.com/messages/CH5JMFBB2).

## Challenges

1. In the `challenges` folder you will find a list of challenges proposed by our partner organizations. Please take time to review them before the event. The more prepared, the more chances your team will have of making good progress during the weekend!
2. Each challenge will have a dedicated Slack channel where you could ask questions and get clarifications. The slack channel for a channel follows the following convention: chal-*challenge_code*. (e.g #[chal-mpv-inf](https://codeforvenezuela.slack.com/messages/CHEG10M7S), [#chal-mit-rea](https://codeforvenezuela.slack.com/messages/CH875RP7T))

If you want to work on a challenge that is not by our partner organizations, you are welcome to do so! Share you challenge in [#hackathon-ga](https://codeforvenezuela.slack.com/messages/CH5JMFBB2).

It is highly likely that there will be more teams than challenges, but fear not! Nothing like tackling problems from different angles to find creative and interesting solutions.

### Submission Guidelines

Each team will present a 3 minute demo on their work. *Remote teams* can record a video and we will present it on site as a part of the final presentations.

**Submission process:**
We will use [**Devpost**](https://c4v-sf-codeathon.devpost.com/) to manage the submission process, *the reviewing panel will only review projects that are uploaded there.*
