# Open Data and Venezuelan Health Indicators

## Background

### Who we are

Human Rights Watch investigates and reports on abuses happening in all corners of the world. We are roughly 450 people of 70-plus nationalities who are country experts, lawyers, journalists, and others who work to protect the most at risk, from vulnerable minorities and civilians in wartime to refugees and children in need.

We direct our advocacy towards governments, armed groups, and businesses, pushing them to change or enforce their laws, policies, and practices. To ensure our independence, we refuse government funding and corporate ties. We partner with organizations large and small across the globe to protect embattled activists and to help hold abusers to account and bring justice to victims.

### Problem statement

Human Rights Watch has been doing research that shows:

*   Increased levels of maternal and infant mortality.
*   The spread of vaccine-preventable diseases, such as measles and diphtheria.
*   Increases in the number of infectious diseases such as malaria and tuberculosis.
*   High levels of food insecurity and child malnutrition.

The report describes the public health implications in Venezuela and abroad, explains government policies that contributed to this crisis, and concludes that the United Nations, at its highest levels, should lead efforts to implement a large-scale assistance plan in Venezuela.

In order to create these reports, we analyzed data provided in "Boletin Epidemiológicos". However, the Venezuelan government stopped publishing those reports in [2017](http://venezuelasindatos.efectococuyo.com/2018/12/09/mas-de-100-semanas-de-silencio-epidemiologico/) [^1], so it is becoming more and more difficult to get this information. In addition to those reports, we started using X as a source.

We would like to make it easier and more transparent to start having access to Venezuelan health data. This could contribute to further research in the future and ….

## Challenge

In order to create more awareness about this issue, we would like to create a platform that makes this information available and discoverable through APIs.  Similar to the work that [PAHO](http://www.paho.org/hq/index.php?option=com_content&view=article&id=2632:2010-interactive-malaria-statistics&Itemid=2130&lang=en) is doing but completely focused on Venezuelan data.

1. **Open Data**: The government used to publish reports about the health data of the country. You will have access to data in this [folder](https://drive.google.com/drive/u/0/folders/1JrNsIx1-jkxWR2VNaJCHk1IFOqKkOnOt). These documents are in a format that are not parseable by computers. The goal of this project is to create a system to parse all this data and make it available through APIs.
    1. __Partnerships - Bonus__:
        1. Explore partnerships with [DataDrum](datadrum.org), [Transparencia Venezuela](https://transparencia.org.ve/) and [Vendata](vendata.org).
        2. Can we make these reports available through their platforms?
2. **Visualization and Outreach**: in order to create awareness about these issues, we want to present this data in a way that is easy to understand by the general public and easy to distribute. The goal of this project is to find creative ways to achieve this. Here are some directions:
    1. Create a "bar chart race" visualization (like [this](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dwZ6B5kalbQ)) using data provided by HRW and PAHO for diseases in Venezuela and how they compare to other parts of the world? 
    2. Using the data from Boletin Epidemiológico, develop maps and dashboards for each Venezuela state? 
    3. Explore the correlation between these diseases and mortality rates.
    4. Explore cases per capita compared to other countries. 


### Skills Required
