## **Who we are**

NEXT-STEP is an organization offering a microfinance program, with experience in Venezuela. The “Red Humanitaria de los Caminantes” provides social services for the “caminantes” (“walkers”), Venezuelans on the go, emigrating to or through Colombia.

## **Problem statement**

Over 3 million Venezuelans have fled their homeland and are working to get settled in a new country. There is a need to support this community and having basic information about them will be key to developing solutions.

## **Challenge**

In that sense, we aim to tackle the “informational challenge” by inviting participants to the Hackathon Code for Venezuela to develop the following:

*   **User registration and Venezuelan identity verification:** create a method to register and verify the identity and nationality of the user and _optionally_ a bar index to measure how certain is the system of the identity and nationality claimed by the user.
*   **Geolocation verification**: create a method to located the user and _optionally_ create a bar index of how certain is the system the user is living at the location that the user claims to be living.
*   **Individuals basic socio-economic indicator:** an indicator based on the registration survey data to provide an index of the level and the type of (1) social and (2) economic assistance required by the individual (e.g., status, demographics, education, health, employment)
*   **Registration and recomendability indicator for service organizations:** create a method to register community services with its geolocation and a recommender system with a start indicator for the organizations or entities providing services, presented in a list by region and by region matching the geolocation of a particular individual.
*   **Regional socio-economic indicator:** create an index to understand the socio economic context at the location of the individual  (two areas humanitarian, e.g. human development index, and economic unemployment and entrepreneurship indicator of the region).
*   **Generate a dataset on where are Venezuelans:** use the number of total user by region (geolocation) as well as open data sources to create a dataset of where Venezuelans have migrated.
*   **Create a data visualization front end**

    The challenge consists in developing at least 3 of the verifications methods and/or indicators listed above, define for each of them its factorial components and find innovative ways to measure and aggregate the factors into a representative index numbers. For regional indexes, national levels indicators will suffix, city or zipcode levels will be a plus. Included in the challenge is to develop a functionality to provide a data visualization front end:  a list or a colored or bubbles map indicating totals of individuals by region and the value of the socio economic indexes. A list of entities providing services (1) per region and (2) in a particular radius of the current location of the individual is also a required functionality.

*   **Open Data**

    The Venezuelan government offers an identification system in the [National Electoral Committee (CNE) website](http://www.cne.gob.ve/web/index.php).  Social media platforms such as facebook, google and others offer data that could be used for identification and localization purposes. UNHRC offers data [on Venezuelan refugees and immigration](https://data2.unhcr.org/en/situations/vensit). Country indicators such as the [human development index](http://hdr.undp.org/en/content/human-development-report-office-statistical-data-api) from UNDP, the progress development index and [GEM](https://www.gemconsortium.org) entrepreneurship indicators are available online.
