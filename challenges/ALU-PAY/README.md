# Automating scholarship payments

## About the organization
AlumnUSB is a non-profit organization that raises funds for Universidad Simón Bolivar. It has several programs to help the university fulfill its academic mission, including sourcing goods (equipment for laboratories, classrooms, offices, and supplies) and providing grants, in the form of scholarships and teaching awards. AlumnUSB is run by USB alumni volunteers around the world who volunteer their time.

## Problem statement
One of AlumnUSB's programs gives financial aid to students of the University with stellar performance. These transfers are done via [Uphold](https://uphold.com), to guarantee that the money is arriving directly to the intended recipient, as they handle the required identity verification. This allows AlumnUSB to operate with transparency.

An AlumnUSB member must manually send transfers to all the grant recipients, a process that currently takes more than two hours every month. We would like a system that automates this process. This will save a tremendous amount of human time and allow us to scale our operations.

## Challenge
 
* Make a script that connects to the [Uphold API](https://uphold.com/en/developer/api) to automate AlumnUSB scholarship payments.
* Bonus 1: Make a frontend for this script and have an UI that AlumnUSB's admins can use to interact with the tool you are creating. 
* Bonus 2: Create a scheduler that automates the process of when and to whom send the financial aid.

## Skills needed
1. Backend APIs
2. Scripting
