# USB Digital Document Signing

## Who we are
Universidad Simón Bolívar is a public university in Miranda state. It is the most prestigious science and technology university in Venezuela, and one of the leading ones in South America. The following challenge is presented by the DACE (Dirección de Admisión y Control de Estudios).

## Problem statement
Documents issued by the university, such as grade reports, need to be signed by one or more people to be considered official.

Requests for signed documents have increased in recent years, and the current process involves paper and physical signatures, which is very costly and scarce in today's Venezuela.

We want to migrate to a web-based system where users can log in, examine documents that are sent to them for verification, and digitally sign them.

To provide more context, a [document](https://github.com/code-for-venezuela/2019-april-sf-hackhathon/files/2949796/USB.proyecto.firma.electronica.documentos.pdf) with a set of requirements is provided to this challenge.

## Challenge

Build a system to manage electronic signatures for official documentation issued by Universidad Simón Bolívar.


COMMENT: I will put this challenge in the context of the situation in Venezuela and the refugee crisis. Many people
leaving the country will benefit for having their credentials certified digitally as they relocate elsewhere.
