#  Visualizing the experience of women migrants

## Who we are
Cepaz is a non-profit organization that works to promote and defend democratic values, human rights and peace in Venezuela. Among other activities, the CEPAZ team generates reports on the humanitarian crisis in Venezuela and submits it to international agencies who can pull resources to respond to the emergency.

## Problem statement
In recent years, CEPAZ started conducting campaigns to raise awareness about the plight of Venezuelan migrants who are crossing the borders in conditions of precariety and who put themselves in a vulnerable situation in order to find better living conditions. Women migrants are in a particular situation of risk and many have been victims to situations of violence and exploitation.

In order to better understand the situation, last year CEPAZ conducted a survey of 700 venezuelan women migrants. The team needs support analyzing and visualizing findings from the survey, so that they can use this information to advocate for support for this population in the receiving countries.


## Challenge


Analyze the survey findings and visualize some of the most significant findings.
