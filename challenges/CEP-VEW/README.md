#  Visualizing the experience of women migrants

## Who we are
[CEPAZ](https://cepaz.org.ve/) is a non-profit organization that works to promote and defend democratic values, human rights and peace in Venezuela. Among other activities, the CEPAZ team generates reports on the humanitarian crisis in Venezuela and submits it to international agencies who can pull resources to respond to the emergency.

## Problem statement
In recent years, CEPAZ started conducting campaigns to raise awareness about the plight of Venezuelan migrants who are crossing the borders in conditions of precarity and who put themselves in a vulnerable situation to find better living conditions. Women migrants are in a particular situation of risk and many have been victims to cases of violence and exploitation.

In order to better understand the situation, last year CEPAZ surveyed 700 Venezuelan women migrants. The team needs support analyzing and visualizing findings from the survey so that they can use this information to advocate for support for this population in the receiving countries.

## Challenge
Analyze the survey data and visualize some of the most significant findings.

**Note: the survey data is pinned to the Slack Channel #chal-cep-wev**
