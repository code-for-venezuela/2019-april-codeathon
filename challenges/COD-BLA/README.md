# Tracking Blackouts in Venezuela

## Who We Are
Codhez ([Comisión para los Derechos Humanos del Estado Zulia](http://www.codhez.ong/)) is a human rights organization which documents, promotes, and defends human rights in the Venezuelan state of Zulia. Our mission is to democratize and decentralize Venezuela through a human rights perspective.

Since 2015, we have provided legal defense for victims of human rights abuses, ranging from torture to extrajudicial executions, within a State which does not respect the Rule of Law. Since 2016, Codhez produces annual reports on the human rights situation in Zulia and organizes cultural and academic events for civil society to become involved with the human rights movement in Venezuela.

## Problem Statement
Government corruption and mismanagement has caused the collapse of the electrical system in Venezuela. In 2018, the state of Zulia suffered [several collapses of the electrical system](http://www.codhez.org.ve/noticias/144-zulia-en-emergencia-electrica.html) given the complete deterioration of thermoelectric plants and the precarious connection to the national Guri hydroelectric dam.

During the month of March 2019, the abandonment of the Guri dam has produced national blackouts that have lasted multiple days in a row along with harsh and irregular rationing of electricity. Currently, the entire state of Zulia only has access to electrical services 4-6 hours a day.

The entire population is deeply affected by the blackouts and severe rationing, limiting access to water, food, medical attention, refrigeration, public transportation, education, and communication. In effect, the blackouts and shortages could be considered a massive violation of Venezuelan human rights.

We want to document who is most affected and how.

## Challenge
The challenge is the creative use of available data to document the impact of the lack of electricity on the human rights situation in Venezuela. [Netblocks](https://netblocks.org/) has begun registering blackouts through the level of internet connection throughout Venezuela and are willing to share their data upon request. Additionally, Venezuelans use Twitter to report not having electricity through the hashtag #SinLuz. Are there other sets of data which could be utilized to collect information on blackouts in Venezuela?

Ideally, the challenge would collect and process internet data on:
1.	Which communities, towns, cities, states in Venezuela do not have electricity? When? For how long?
2.	How are people affected? That is, are important institutions such as hospitals or schools reporting not having electricity? Where does lack of electricity also mean there is no access to water or telecommunications?
3.	Are there patterns we can discern about how the government is rationing electricity in different communities so that people can prepare their daily routines?

Finally, the application would process and visualize the data for its consumption and analysis by human rights defenders in Venezuela. [Open source examples](https://github.com/Aerolab/acanohayluz/) of this already exist through a web app called [Acá No Hay Luz](https://acanohayluz.com/).
