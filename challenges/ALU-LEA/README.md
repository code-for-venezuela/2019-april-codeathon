# AlumnUSB donor leaderboard

## Who we are
AlumnUSB is a non-profit organization that raises funds for Universidad Simón Bolivar. It has several programs to help the university fulfill its academic mission, including sourcing goods (equipment for laboratories, classrooms, offices, and supplies) and providing grants in the form of scholarships and teaching awards. AlumnUSB is run by USB alumni volunteers around the world who volunteer their time.

## Problem statement
AlumnUSB maintains a log of all donations made to the organization. We would like to showcase this data with graphics that recognize frequent donors and large donors.

We'll add the leaderboards to our website so we can encourage more alumni and friends to donate, in the spirit of gamification.

## Challenge

Design and create an HTML donor leaderboards to recognize and encourage contributions to AlumnUSB.

## Skills needed
- HTML, CSS, JavaScript
- Data visualization

## Project Scope

* We believe this project is perfect for a team of 2 or 3 people to take on. This is a small to medium effort project.
