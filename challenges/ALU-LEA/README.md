# AlumnUSB donor leaderboard

## Who we are
AlumnUSB is a non-profit organization that raises funds for Universidad Sim√≥n Bolivar. It has several programs to help the university fulfill its academic mission, including sourcing goods (equipment for laboratories, classrooms, offices, and supplies) and providing grants in the form of scholarships and teaching awards. AlumnUSB is run by USB alumni volunteers around the world who volunteer their time.

## Problem statement
AlumnUSB maintains a log of all donations made to the organization. We would like to showcase this data with graphics that recognize frequent donors and large donors.

We'll add the leaderboards to our website so we can encourage more alumni and friends to donate, in the spirit of gamification.

Two csv files are provided as part of this challenge that you can use to create the leader board:
- [Donations info](donations_code4vzla.csv)
- [Contact Information Sample](mockcontacts_codevzla.csv)
## Challenge
Design and create an HTML donor leaderboards to recognize and encourage contributions to AlumnUSB.
The leaderboards shall support a dynamic data source as well as display correctly in all form factorg
(eg: smartphones).

## Skills needed
- HTML, CSS, JavaScript
- Data visualization

## Project Scope
We believe this project is perfect for a team of 2 or 3 people to take on. This is a small to medium effort project.
