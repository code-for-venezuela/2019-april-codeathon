# Hearts On Venezuela

## Who We Are
Codhez ([Comisión para los Derechos Humanos del Estado Zulia](http://www.codhez.ong/)) is a human rights organization which documents, promotes, and defends human rights in the Venezuelan state of Zulia. Our mission is to democratize and decentralize Venezuela through a human rights perspective.

Since 2015, we have provided legal defense for victims of human rights abuses, ranging from torture to extrajudicial executions, within a State which does not respect the Rule of Law. Since 2016, Codhez produces annual reports on the human rights situation in Zulia and organizes cultural and academic events for civil society to become involved with the human rights movement in Venezuela.

## Problem Statement
Venezuelans are currently being doubly repressed, on the one hand by a brutal complex humanitarian emergency caused by government corruption and mismanagement, and on the other hand by the violation of political and civil rights under the Maduro dictatorship. This situation has deserved the attention of people and governments world-wide.

Trump’s firm stance against Maduro has generated a response to the Venezuelan crisis by people throughout the world that is more focused on being anti-Trump rather than prioritizing the needs and desires of the Venezuelan people. As a result, the voice of Venezuelans has been ignored in international conversations about Venezuelan politics and our future – prioritizing US politics – despite Venezuela having a vibrant civil society which is organized to peacefully end the dictatorship and end the humanitarian emergency.

Three of the leading non-government organizations in Venezuela – Provea, Civilis, and Codhez – are joining forces to create the Hearts On Venezuela campaign, focused on making sure that Venezuelans lead the international conversations about our country and that people across the world can support the initiatives that can positively transform Venezuela. The central activity of the campaign is to translate content produced by Venezuelans into English in order to reach a wider chunk of the globe.

## Challenge
The challenge is to create an attractive website for the Hearts On Venezuela campaign through which people learn about and act in solidarity with Venezuelans on the ground, led by the Venezuelan human rights movement. The web platform should contain several functions, discussed below.

### Display and organize content
A central objective of the website is to elevate Venezuelan voices and experiences, curated by the Venezuelan human rights movement. The website should be able to display and categorize the content which has been previously translated from Spanish to English.

### Volunteers
Volunteers will be central to the process of translating material en masse to populate the website with translated content. However, the campaign is an opportunity to build out a volunteer infrastructure which can strengthen the national human rights movement. The web platform should facilitate the creation of a membership in which people can share the skills they are willing to contribute with, categorizing them and visualizing them appropriately for organizers to harness this volunteer force.

Be creative with this aspect. Can we create a permanent and sustainable volunteer group of coders through a forum? Can we incorporate collaborative translations in the way Github creates collaborative coding? Think big (and practical).

### Design
The design of the website is extremely important as it will communicate the spirit of the campaign. We are here create awareness, to create solidarity, to respect the truth and suffering of those on the ground, to promote democracy and free elections, to understand that the current global political configuration is complicated and that in this context it is vital to work with the people on the ground risking everything to improve the conditions for everyone. It is attractive, inspiring, inviting to all.
